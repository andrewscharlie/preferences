* DONE Clean up save line item forecast in XFP API
  CLOSED: [2014-09-24 Wed 16:09]

Right now, we're not specifying the root entities correctly. This is causing us to have to iterate through all shards when retrieving line item forecasts, which is incredibly inefficient. On top of this, we have multiple representations of a line item forecast, which should all just use the domain object instead.

** DONE Find out why the PEBL and Agave versions of the forecast don't match in AutomatedForecastManagerImplTest
   CLOSED: [2014-09-24 Wed 15:43] SCHEDULED: <2014-09-24 Wed>

*** For some reason isOverbooked isn't matching between the Agave and PEBL tests. The test "testUpdateForecastsForNetwork_automatedIsStale()" is a good example of this happening.

*** When we save the LineItemForecast, isOverbooked is null as expected. When we query the LineItemForecastPeblDao, it's still null. However, when we mark it as null, by the time that we're making a copy of it in the LineItemForecastProtoAdapter copy constructor, isOverbooked is now false instead of null. This is unexpected.

*** After thinking on it for a bit, it doesn't seem within the scope of this CL to fix this problem. It seems that when I do what the old test was doing - just setting isOverbooked to false - things start working, and I don't want to chase down this rabbit hole for any longer.
